Hi, Iâ€™m Trevor. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an engineer at heartâ€“always looking to better understand the world around me. I am always learning.

Iâ€™ve lived in Colorado, Kansas City (both the Kansas and Missouri sides), and eastern Washington. I currently reside in Portland, OR.

I love to travel, explore, and read. You can usually find my wife and me hiking somewhere new, biking, or sipping coffee.

I have over 5 years of experience leading technical and industrial, data based projects.

If you want to join me in finding new and useful ways to understand data and build a better world, letâ€™s get in touch at hire@trevorb.io.
