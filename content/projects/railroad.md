## Terminal Process Control

I traveled across BNSF Railway's system developing and testing Terminal Process Control (TPC) in BNSF's major rail hubs.  My experience with this project inspired me to pursue a full-time career in data science!

TPC is a modern control system for automatically sorting train cars at [classification (hump) yards](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=19&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjLmpvti_XmAhVNj54KHUoXDX0QygQwEnoECAIQBw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FClassification_yard%23Hump_yard&usg=AOvVaw1lfyrbpmsKRMIIWBMu9T46). 160-ton train cars are rolled down a hill while TPC controls their speed and routes them to a destination.  The largest yards process over 2000 cars per day!

The coolest thing about TPC: it learns.  I tuned learning algorithms to ensure the system would properly control the speeds of train cars.  At every major point in the cars route, the speed is taken and the system adjusts to ensure that the cars enter their tracks at a safe speed while maintaining an efficient throughput.

## Leading Technical Staff

While at BNSF, I also led a team of 14 skilled technicians to upgrade and maintain a classification yard, 2 movable railroad bridges, and 50 miles of transcontinental wayside signal equipment in eastern Washington.

I managed the installation of new signal systems and the fast rebuilding of systems in emergency situations.

In 2017, there was some major flooding in Connell, Washington.  My team and I responded to monitor equipment conditions for safety and to be poised to quickly resume operations.  As the major arteries of US commerce, a transcontinental outage could have outsized impact on the region.

Flooding outside Connell, WA.  Safe restoration of service as quickly as possible was critical.

The summer after these floods, fires near the Columbia River took off.  After the fire below burned itself out, I managed the inspection of systems to ensure that signal systems were safe for operations.
